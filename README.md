# weather_app

A Weather App which tells us about the weather and conditions of a city.



## Setup of the Project

1. I added dependencies to the project that were needed.
2. Made sure that all of the packages and versions are updated and compatible.


## Coding

I coded the entire project at once and uploaded it at Github. 

Firstly, I took care of the controller which was responsible for getting the data from the API.
Then I took care of the UI of the App. I made it very simple as I had a very short time-limit.

For the state management, i used GETX. 

Slowly adding more features such as favorite city feature, dark mode and notifications.

After which, I implemented the Responsive UI and made sure that the app worked fine on both Mobiles and Tablets.
